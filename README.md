HW3correlation is a grammar of data manipulation, providing functions that help you calculate the most common correlation values between two variables.

 * `cor_check`check if there is NA, empty cells, non-numeric, or unpaired values in each variable, and make sure there are at least 3 observations in each variable.
 * `cor_pearson`Calculate the Pearson correlation between two variables.
 * `cor_check`Calculate the Spearman correlation between two variables.
 * `cor_check`Calculate the Kendallâ€™s tau-b between two variables.
 
 If you are new to this package, you can learn more about these functions in `vignette("Tutorial_for_HW3correlation")`.
